# Movie-Recommender-System
This repository contains a Movie Recommender System built using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The system recommends movies to users based on their  fed input.
Features:

    Collaborative Filtering: Leverages user and item-based collaborative filtering methods to recommend movies based on similar users' preferences.
    Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies by analyzing the attributes of movies (genres, directors, etc.) that a user has liked in the past.
    Hybrid Approach: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to provide more accurate recommendations.
    User Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface built with Flask that allows users to search for movies and receive personalized recommendations.
    Data Visualization: Includes tools for visualizing user preferences and recommendation accuracy.
    Scalable: The system is designed to be scalable and can handle large datasets of movies and users.

Technologies Used:

    Python: Core logic and algorithms.
    Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
    Scikit-Learn: Implementation of machine learning algorithms.
    Flask: Web framework for the user interface.
    SQLite: For storing user preferences and movie data (can be easily swapped with a more scalable database).
    Jupyter Notebooks: For exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
